            <h3>Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection</h3>
            <p>
                This project addresses the critical challenge of detecting cyber threats in network traffic using machine learning. 
                The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, included features like network packet size, login attempts, session duration, 
                IP reputation score, failed logins, unusual time access, protocol type, encryption used, and browser type. 
                The target variable was binary: attack detected (Yes/No).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Model Selection:</strong> Random Forest classifier was used for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data. 
                Hyperparameter tuning was performed using Grid Search to optimize performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Deployment:</strong> The model was deployed as an interactive web application using Gradio and hosted on Hugging Face Spaces for real-time predictions.

            <h3>Phishing Email Detection</h3>
            <p>
                This project focuses on detecting phishing emails using machine learning. The dataset sourced from Kaggle included email text and  
                labels. The target variable was binary: phishing (0/1). zero(0) means the email is legitimate and one(1) means its a phishing email.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Model Selection:</strong> A RandomForestClassifier model was used for its interpretability and effectiveness in binary classification tasks. 
                Feature engineering included TF-IDF vectorization for text data and tokenization for additional context.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Deployment:</strong> The model was deployed as an interactive web application using Gradio and hosted on Hugging Face Spaces for real-time predictions.

            <h3>Home Intruder Detection</h3>
            <p>
                This project focuses on detecting intruders in home environments using computer vision. The dataset was collected and annotated using Roboflow, 
                containing images of various home intrusion scenarios. The model was trained to detect and classify potential intruders.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Model Selection:</strong> Used YOLOv11 (a pretrained object detection model) for its real-time detection capabilities and high accuracy in identifying persons. 
                Training was performed on Google Colab leveraging GPU acceleration.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Deployment:</strong> The model was deployed as an interactive web application using Gradio, allowing users to upload images or use real-time camera input for detection. 
                The application is hosted permanently on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access.

    <h3>Email Spam Detector</h3>
    <p>
        This project tackles email spam classification using machine learning. 
        The dataset was sourced from the <strong>Enron Email Dataset</strong>, featuring raw email content, 
        sender/recipient metadata, and subject lines. Key preprocessing included text cleaning, 
        stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Model Selection:</strong> Naive Bayes classifier was chosen for its efficiency with text data 
        and probabilistic spam detection capabilities. The model achieved 98% accuracy on test data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Deployment:</strong> Deployed as an interactive web app using Gradio, hosted permanently on 
        Hugging Face Spaces for real-time spam predictions (1 = SPAM, 0 = NOT SPAM).
